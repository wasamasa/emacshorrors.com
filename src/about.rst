((title . "About"))

To paraphrase `a comment by eevee`_ every good programmer can not only
endlessly discuss the benefits of their favourite programming
language, but easily bore you to death by elaborating upon its
wrongdoings, flaws and warts. Because I'm an Emacs hacker, I discover
the aforementioned problems on a regular basis, no matter whether I'm
actively writing code or just read its sources to understand how this
complicated menagerie of tasks more or less related to text editing
works.

As it would be too wasteful to just put my fits of rage on ephemeral
media like the `#emacs IRC channel`_, I've decided to share these
highlights with you on a blog in the form of entries that may very
well fit into a single tweet or approach the size of an essay
dissecting existentialist worries.  And don't worry, these post are
for entertainment and educational purposes.  I just like to rant every
now and often, that's all.
